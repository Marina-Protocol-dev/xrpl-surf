# xrpl-surf

**Note:** This documentation describes the process of issuing the Marina Protocol Utility Token (SURF) within the XRP Ledger ecosystem. The key functionalities are:

1. Issuing SURF tokens from a cold wallet to a hot wallet.
2. Issuing SURF tokens based on user requests, where the number of SURF tokens corresponds to the requested amount of psurf points.

Please be aware that these functions are based on scenario-driven testing and have not yet been deployed in a production environment.
